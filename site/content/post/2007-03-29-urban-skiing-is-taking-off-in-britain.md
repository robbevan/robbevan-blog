    You can hear the shout of outrage from an attendant at Angel station as the young Norwegian casually straps on his skis and begins a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFqQOlYE4EE">terrifying descent</a> of the London tube network's highest escalator with a camera strapped to his head. What London Underground called a "dangerous, stupid and irresponsible" stunt has, predictably, become the latest YouTube sensation, generating 2,000 views every hour yesterday. The skier, a publicity-shy Norwegian in his 20s, whom friends say is called Arild, hurtles down the 90-metre up escalator in north London, skidding safely to a halt at the bottom to the applause of passersby.
