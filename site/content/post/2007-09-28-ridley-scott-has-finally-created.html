    The director's cut removed the voice-over and that silly ending and put in the unicorn daydream,
    but the disc didn't look that great. And it should look great, because Blade Runner at the time
    was pretty formidable â€” it's pretty formidable even now, actually. A lot of people don't notice
    whether they're watching something beautifully technical or not, but it's important to me. So
    that always got in the way of the director's cut being the final version. I think it's final now
    because I've done all the nips and tucks and tidied up one or two of the visual areas that we
    couldn't do properly at the time because we didn't have the technology.
