    The way I see it, there are certain things I ought to be doing to be productive and effective no matter
    what my goals are. These are things that are relatively easy to set up, but take discipline and awareness
    to maintain. I really think that if I focus on maintaining these habits or processes, then the goals will
    take care of themselves.

  <p>Basically, I’ve made a list of personal unit tests: assertions about myself that I’d like to be true.</p>
