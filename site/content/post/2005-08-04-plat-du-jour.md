The long-awaited (by me at least) new album [Plat du Jour][1] from Matthew Herbert was released last week. Over two years in the making this is a &#8216;concept&#8217; album about &#8220;the international language of food&#8221; with some great tunes, including two standout tracks: [Celebrity][2], made entirely from food aimed at children endorsed by celebrities and the only vocal track (&#8220;Go Gordon, go Ramsay, go Beyonc&eacute;&#8230;&#8221;) and [The Nine Seeds Of Navdanya][3], generated from seeds provided by a conservation organisation in India. Check out the Plat du Jour website for the complete [list of &#8216;ingredients&#8217;][4] for each track including a grain of sugar, 30,000 chickens, a salmon farm and the sewers below London (then download the album [here][5] for a fiver.)

Not unsurprisingly it&#8217;s perfect to listen to in the kitchen, especially if you&#8217;ve got a lot of chopping or mixing to do.
