The [Getting Things Done][1] meme is not just [exploding across the web][2]: recently Victoria Moore in the Weekend Guardian [refered to a *liquorice tea*][3] as stuff that &#8220;somehow encourages the transparent and focused mind required to Get Things Done&#8221; (it&#8217;s the capitalisation that gives it away, surely: and clearly a reference to David Allen&#8217;s &#8220;mind like water&#8221;, a state in which you only give the attention to things that they deserve).

Now liquorice is one of my favourite things, and something described as &#8220;more like a shape than a taste&#8221; just had to be worth trying, especially if it was likely to give me a productivity boost too. I managed to track it down at [Goodness Direct][4] and ordered three boxes*. And then had to wait ages, as a high demand for [Yogi Tea Licorice Egyptian Spice][5] meant there was none in stock. The verdict? Yes, it really does &#8220;curl around your mouth in the most extraordinary way&#8221;&#8230;

(*If you decide to order some for yourself, tell them I sent you and quote this reference: RB38986W.)

<div class="update">
  Update: according to recent Iranian research, liquorice can apparently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3112606.stm">lower testosterone</a> in men. Not sure that this is really helpful from a productivity point of view&#8230; curiously it also seems to help women <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1378652.stm">have their babies earlier</a>.
