Like [Shozu][1], new S60 app [Merkitys][2] (Finnish for &#8216;Meaning&#8217;) allows easy upload of images from your phone to [Flickr][3] (or [your own server][4]). Merkitys however also automatically adds &#8216;context&#8217;, which includes location (i.e. GSM location information: Mobile Country Code, Mobile Network Code, Location Area Code and Cell ID, but also GPS data if you also have a supported receiver) as well as the usual user-defined description and tags etc., and &#8211; curiously &#8211; the addresses of <span class="hilite">all</span> bluetooth devices in the vicinity. Although this is only the first beta release, it [worked flawlessly][5] for me. The source is also [available][6].
