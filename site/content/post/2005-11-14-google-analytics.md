A few months ago Google bought [Urchin][1], provider of web analytics software &#8216;used by over 20% of the Fortune 500&#8242; and also, until their recent move, by [TextDrive][2] where this site is hosted. TextDrive seemed unable to re-negotiate a site license for Urchin (and began work on a home-grown Ruby on Rails solution code-named Anemone). Here&#8217;s the reason why: [Google Analytics][3], released today, is essentially Urchin 5 for free. And I was just thinking about buying [Mint][4].

If you&#8217;re looking for something more immediate (Google Analytics only updates every hour), try Tom Dyson&#8217;s [Peastat][5] a simple, free, &#8216;live&#8217; web stats analyser which &#8220;looks at the last chunk of your log file to create real-time summaries of recent user activity&#8221; and best of <span class="hilite">all</span> provides an Atom feed.

  Update: not sure what&#8217;s up with Analytics. Ever since I signed up, my account&#8217;s status has been &#8216;Waiting for Data&#8217; (although clicking on &#8216;View Reports&#8217; does take me through to stats).</p> <p>

    Today though, I&#8217;m just getting redirected to google.co.uk after logging in. (Still that gave me a chance to check out the five finalists for the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/events/doodle4google.html">Doodle 4 Google</a> competition.)

    Maybe they&#8217;re trying to sort out relationships with their<a href="http://onotech.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_onotech_archive.html#113200904055483341"> paying customers</a> first. </div> <div class="update">
      Update: Looks like Google are once again <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/progress.html">accepting new signups</a> and additional profiles for existing accounts. And, if like me you&#8217;re frustrated that Analytics doesn&#8217;t play well with Safari, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/google-analytics-hates-safari/#c110457">a useful tip</a> on how to force graphs etc. to render correctly.
