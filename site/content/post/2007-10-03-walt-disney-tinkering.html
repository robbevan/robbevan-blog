  <p>
    Announcing that he was going to launch an animated feature, he told the story of Snow White, not just telling it but acting
    it out, assuming the characters’ mannerisms, putting on their voices, letting his audience visualise exactly what they
    would be seeing on the screen. He became Snow White and the wicked queen and the prince and each of the dwarfs . . .
    The performance took over three hours . . . ‘That one performance lasted us three years,’ one animator claimed. ‘Whenever
    we’d get stuck, we’d remember how Walt did it on that night.’
