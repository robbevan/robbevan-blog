    Mr. Eliasson, a former Scandinavian break-dancing champion, is no stranger to situations involving physical challenge or public spectacle. But the performances behind his photography trips are of a more intimate, meditative nature.

      <p>Arranged in a grid, the photographs recall the repetitive images of the German photographers Berndt and Hilla Becher, or even Donald Judd’s stacked boxes. Mr. Eliasson said he was less interested in eliminating individuality than in suggesting a wall with windows. “I like the idea,” he said, “that you could walk up to each window and hear a different story.”</p>
