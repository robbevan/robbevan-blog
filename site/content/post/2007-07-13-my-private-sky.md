  <p>When a buyer orders his set of plates he gives his date and place of birth. The buyer’s personal night sky map is then calculated by a custom computer program and printed onto a set of blueprints followed by Nymphenburg’s master porcelain painters. Each set of dinner plates involves the hand-painting of some 500 stars, nebulae, planets and constellations in gold and platinum.</p>
