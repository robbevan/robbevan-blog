    “Rendezvous” was the name used for the annual meeting of mountain men and fur buyers during the
    Western fur trade era, where trappers would exchange beaver skins for supplies and goods they wanted. 
    These events occurred between the early 1820s and the 1840s, coming to an end when the price of beaver 
    skins fell due to changes in fashion. It is now used for any gathering in the buckskinning historical 
    re-enactment hobby
