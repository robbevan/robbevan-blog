Like most of the UK&#8217;s web development community I was at the Carson Workshops [Future of Web Apps][1] summit a couple of weeks ago. A couple of highlights for me were [Tom Coates&#8217;][2] wonderfully lucid and entertaining synthesis of <span class="hilite">all</span> things Web 2.0 (see also [Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s][3] [annotations][4] of Tom&#8217;s slides) and [David Heinemeier Hansson&#8217;s][5] Ruby on Rails &#8216;sermon&#8217;. Although I&#8217;ve been working with Rails intermittently for at least eighteen months I&#8217;ve never seen David speak and it had never really occurred to me before just how **Scandinavian** Rails is: minimal, beautifully designed and good for the soul.

Anyway, by now, the talks (sorry, &#8216;podcasts&#8217;) are <span class="hilite">all</span> [available for download][1], there are numerous write-ups (best of which are [Simon Willison&#8217;s notes][9]), hundreds of [Flickr images][10] and [Lars Plougmann&#8217;s][11] [mindmaps][12].
