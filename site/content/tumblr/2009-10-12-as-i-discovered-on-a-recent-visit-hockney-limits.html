title: As I discovered on a recent visit, Hockney limits his contact with the screen
  exclusively to the pad of his thumb. “The thing is,” Hockney explains, “if you are
  using your pointer or other fingers, you actually have to be working from your elbow.
  Only the thumb has the opposable joint which allows you to move over the screen
  with maximum speed and agility, and the screen is exactly the right size, you can
  easily reach every corner with your thumb.”
