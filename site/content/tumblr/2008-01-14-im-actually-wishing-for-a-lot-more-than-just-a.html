title: I’m actually wishing for a lot more than just a task tracking system. I’m really
  looking for something to provide some semblance of meaning outside of myself. I
  think such a system would be the keeper of my goals and projects. Additionally,
  the system would “know where I am” in terms of goals and projects at all times,
  maintaining a sense of continuity for me when my attention is elsewhere. The two
  tangible deliveries of the system would be (1) a “map” with a big arrow that says
  YOU ARE HERE, and (2) the set of tasks that I know will make that arrow move a certain
  distance.
