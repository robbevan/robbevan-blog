title: Building Open Library, we faced a difficult new technical problem. We wanted
  a database that could hold tens of millions of records, that would allow random
  users to modify its entries and keep a full history of their changes, and that would
  hold arbitrary semi-structured data as users added it. Each of these problems had
  been solved on its own, but nobody had yet built a technology that solved all three
  together. So we created ThingDB (tdb), a new database framework that gives us this
  flexibility. ThingDB stores a collection of objects, called “things”. For example,
  on the Open Library site, each page, book, author, and user is a thing in the database.
  Each thing then has a series of arbitrary key-value pairs as properties.
