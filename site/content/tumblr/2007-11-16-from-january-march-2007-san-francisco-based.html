title: 'From January - March 2007 San Francisco-based artist Jill Miller trained with
  a licensed private investigator. She worked on real cases, learning various components
  of the profession, from video surveillance to location stake-outs to note-taking
  methodology. Miller began this project out of her interest in the ways that the
  legal system protects (or challenges) an individual’s right to privacy. Driven by
  this curiosity, she learned how to conduct surveillance within the legal limits
  of the law. Once familiar with the field, Miller executed her own plans for surveillance
  under the advisement of the private investigator. Only this time, instead of working
  on randomly assigned cases, Miller turned an eye onto the art world itself, spending
  6 months undercover doing surveillance on some of the San Francisco art world’s
  most elusive community: art collectors.'
