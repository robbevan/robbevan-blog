title: 'Do not burn yourselves out. Be as I am, a reluctant enthusiast, a part time
  crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves and your lives
  for pleasure and adventure. It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more
  important to enjoy it. While you can. While it is still there. So go out there and
  hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the
  forests, encounter the grizz, climb the mountains, and bag the peaks…. and I promise
  you this much: I promise you this one sweet victory over your enemies, over those
  deskbound people with their hearts in a safe deposit box… I promise you this: you
  will outlive the bastards.'
