title: The Hungarian composer Antal Borsos (1916-1979) was known for works of a traditional
  nature until the early 1960s, when he began to dabble with the avant garde. He was
  particularly interested in incorporating organic noises and envisioned a symphony
  developed from the ‘music’ produced by plants (creaking trees, snapping buds etc).
  His Fugue in C major (No.50) used a recording he made of rhubarb growing inside
  metal bins (forced rhubarb famously grows so quickly that it can be heard expanding).
  His wife Ilona, who did not share his interest in the experimental, teased him remorselessly
  about his 'silly musical fruits’. Eventually they divorced - probably a mistake
  on her part. Within a year, she was remarried to her dentist, who murdered her on
  their honeymoon.
