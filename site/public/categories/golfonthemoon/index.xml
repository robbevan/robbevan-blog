      <description>To celebrate the success of the PlayTime event and continue Tim Wright&amp;#8217;s mission to play golf on the moon (with David Bowie), XPT is offering a iPod Shuffle to the person who comes up with the best photographic simulation of a particular aspect of the the 30-year plan.

By concretising events and situations in a series of manipulated images, we are making the whole project more real, more achievable. Simulation=Solution.</description>

      <title>PlayTime: Playing with Pictures</title>

      <description>A few weeks on, I&amp;#8217;m finally getting around to uploading my slides from my PlayTime presentation, Playing with Pictures (it&amp;#8217;s a 20MB+ PDF file, exported from Keynote). I was intending to annotate these so that they&amp;#8217;d make more sense to someone who weren&amp;#8217;t at my session, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure when, if ever, I&amp;#8217;ll do this.

This gist of it however was this: Photo manipulation has always had a bit of a bad name, and even today we&amp;#8217;re still worried that adding, removing or modifying parts of a photographic image detract from photography&amp;#8217;s perceived ability to show us the truth.</description>
