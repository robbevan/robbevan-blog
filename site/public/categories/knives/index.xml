      <description>A guy called Jacob called at my house today. He said he&amp;#8217;d been staying with my neighbour Roger and was on his way back to Holland after a catering trade show at RAF Benson, nearby. He didn&amp;#8217;t want to take all his stock back on the ferry with him: were we interested in taking any of it off his hands? If we could cover his costs he&amp;#8217;d let us have an entire case of knives and a 12-piece cookware set for roughly 10% of the retail price (1425 EURO for the pans, 795 for the knives).</description>
