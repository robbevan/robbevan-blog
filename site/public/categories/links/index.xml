      <description>From del.ico.us/blog:
 This is a big step for del.icio.us, but one that I hope will make it more useful. Because del.icio.us is all about sharing and we donâ€™t want to discourage that, we will be watching how this feature impacts the community and will also be experimenting a bit with the UI over the next few weeks.

      <description>Whilst searching the Opera Mobile forums, I came across this fairly comprehensive list of free software for S60 phones. Some of the links are broken and there&amp;#8217;s nothing on the development side, but a useful list nonetheless.
Also, if you&amp;#8217;re excited by the prospect of Flash Lite 2.0 announced back in November, you&amp;#8217;ll also be excited to hear from this official forum post that this will be available to developers from Macromedia Labs in January.</description>

      <description>In the first in an occasional series of &amp;#8216;linked links&amp;#8217; and by way of tribute to Merlin Mann&amp;#8217;s 5ives here are some great stories from the English version of Aftenposten, Norway&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;leading quality daily&amp;#8217; that I&amp;#8217;ve bookmarked at del.icio.us* recently.
(I&amp;#8217;m half-Norwegian, so I enjoy keeping up-to-date with what&amp;#8217;s happening in the &amp;#8216;motherland&amp;#8217;, but it&amp;#8217;s a great feed nevertheless.)
Giant boulder closes highway  A boulder weighing roughly 50 tons has shut down highway 715, one of the traffic arteries to Trondheim.</description>
