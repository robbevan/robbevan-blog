      <description>Bruce Sterling is doing the rounds in London at the moment: I caught him on Monday at a New Statesman event upstairs at the Grouse and Claret. Bruce gave a highly entertaining &amp;#8216;cyberpunk exegesis&amp;#8217; of a bewildering array of contemporary issues and ideas: the UK&amp;#8217;s surveillance culture, Web 2.0, Climate Change and of course the Internet of Things to name just a few. Good &amp;#8216;names&amp;#8217; for things seem more important than ever now: Bruce mentioned that Tim O&amp;#8217;Reilly &amp;#8211; who coined the term Web 2.</description>

      <description>I was invited today by one of my clients &amp;#8211; The Climate Group &amp;#8211; to watch Al Gore give his presentation on Climate Change at the bfi London IMAX Cinema. Gore&amp;#8217;s presentation is pretty well covered elsewhere, so I&amp;#8217;m not even going to try and summarise it here (it was too dark to take notes and besides I&amp;#8217;m a lousy note-taker anyway). Suffice to say for someone who has a reputation for being boring, he&amp;#8217;s both funny and extremely passionate about our need to find a common moral purpose to deal with this &amp;#8220;planetary emergency&amp;#8221;.</description>
