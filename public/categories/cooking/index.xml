      <description>From The Jean-Paul Sartre Cookbook:
 I keep creating omelets one after another, like soldiers marching into the sea, but each one seems empty, hollow, like stone. I want to create an omelet that expresses the meaninglessness of existence, and instead they taste like cheese.

      <description>Knowing my predilection for liquorice, some family members recently brought me box of crushed liquorice root back from Egypt. Rather than drink the infusion, I thought I&amp;#8217;d attempt to recreate a Heston Blumenthal dish we ate at the Fat Duck 18 months ago: SALMON POACHED WITH LIQUORICE. I remembered I&amp;#8217;d kept Blumenthal&amp;#8217;s recipe for liquorice jelly from The Guardian in 2003 for exactly this reason. The dish we ate at the Fat Duck was garnished with chicory (without doubt the best chicory I&amp;#8217;ve ever tasted), but The Guardian version (and the version on today&amp;#8217;s menu at the Fat Duck) recommends pink grapefruit and asparagus alongside the salmon, as &amp;#8220;both liquorice and asparagus contain a compound called asparagine&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>This discussion (&amp;#8220;Sourdough puts the art of hacking back into breadmaking&amp;#8221;) reminded me that my sourdough starter is currently in hibernation:</description>

      <description>Whilst doing some research on Food Science, and on Nicholas Kurti in particular, the so-called &amp;#8216;father of Molecular Gastronomy&amp;#8217;, I discovered that Oxford&amp;#8217;s Science Area, where Kurti worked and not far from where I live, is renowned for once having been the &amp;#8216;coldest spot on Earth&amp;#8217;: &amp;#8220;Using demagnetisation of nuclear alignment, Professor Kurti was able to create temperatures of a millionth of a degree above absolute zero.&amp;#8221;
Cool.
Kurti&amp;#8217;s interest in what he called &amp;#8216;gastronomic physics&amp;#8217; also led him to invent an &amp;#8216;Inverted Baked Alaska&amp;#8216; which consisted of frozen meringue filled with piping hot apricot puree, described as &amp;#8216;sticking a spoon into Iceland and getting an eyeful of magma&amp;#8217;.</description>
