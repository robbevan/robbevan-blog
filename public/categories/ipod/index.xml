      <description>About the only good thing to result from the theft of my bag just before Christmas was replacing my ageing original 1G iPod with a sleek new black 5G video iPod (whoever thought that glossy white &amp;#8216;iBook&amp;#8217; look was a good idea?). Actually that&amp;#8217;s not strictly true: I&amp;#8217;ve effectively &amp;#8216;upgraded&amp;#8217; many of my closest and most familiar possessions at the cost of many hours cancelling credit cards, talking to insurers and replacing missing Christmas gifts.</description>
