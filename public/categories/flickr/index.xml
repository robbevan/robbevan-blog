      <description>Like most of the UK&amp;#8217;s web development community I was at the Carson Workshops Future of Web Apps summit a couple of weeks ago. A couple of highlights for me were Tom Coates&amp;#8217; wonderfully lucid and entertaining synthesis of all things Web 2.0 (see also Jeremy Zawodny&amp;#8217;s annotations of Tom&amp;#8217;s slides) and David Heinemeier Hansson&amp;#8217;s Ruby on Rails &amp;#8216;sermon&amp;#8217;. Although I&amp;#8217;ve been working with Rails intermittently for at least eighteen months I&amp;#8217;ve never seen David speak and it had never really occurred to me before just how Scandinavian Rails is: minimal, beautifully designed and good for the soul.</description>
