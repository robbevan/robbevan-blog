      <description>Bruce Sterling is doing the rounds in London at the moment: I caught him on Monday at a New Statesman event upstairs at the Grouse and Claret. Bruce gave a highly entertaining &amp;#8216;cyberpunk exegesis&amp;#8217; of a bewildering array of contemporary issues and ideas: the UK&amp;#8217;s surveillance culture, Web 2.0, Climate Change and of course the Internet of Things to name just a few. Good &amp;#8216;names&amp;#8217; for things seem more important than ever now: Bruce mentioned that Tim O&amp;#8217;Reilly &amp;#8211; who coined the term Web 2.</description>

      <description>From del.ico.us/blog:
 This is a big step for del.icio.us, but one that I hope will make it more useful. Because del.icio.us is all about sharing and we donâ€™t want to discourage that, we will be watching how this feature impacts the community and will also be experimenting a bit with the UI over the next few weeks.

      <description>Like most of the UK&amp;#8217;s web development community I was at the Carson Workshops Future of Web Apps summit a couple of weeks ago. A couple of highlights for me were Tom Coates&amp;#8217; wonderfully lucid and entertaining synthesis of all things Web 2.0 (see also Jeremy Zawodny&amp;#8217;s annotations of Tom&amp;#8217;s slides) and David Heinemeier Hansson&amp;#8217;s Ruby on Rails &amp;#8216;sermon&amp;#8217;. Although I&amp;#8217;ve been working with Rails intermittently for at least eighteen months I&amp;#8217;ve never seen David speak and it had never really occurred to me before just how Scandinavian Rails is: minimal, beautifully designed and good for the soul.</description>
