      <description>To celebrate the success of the PlayTime event and continue Tim Wright&amp;#8217;s mission to play golf on the moon (with David Bowie), XPT is offering a iPod Shuffle to the person who comes up with the best photographic simulation of a particular aspect of the the 30-year plan.

By concretising events and situations in a series of manipulated images, we are making the whole project more real, more achievable. Simulation=Solution.</description>

      <title>PlayTime: Playing with Pictures</title>

      <description>A few weeks on, I&amp;#8217;m finally getting around to uploading my slides from my PlayTime presentation, Playing with Pictures (it&amp;#8217;s a 20MB+ PDF file, exported from Keynote). I was intending to annotate these so that they&amp;#8217;d make more sense to someone who weren&amp;#8217;t at my session, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure when, if ever, I&amp;#8217;ll do this.

This gist of it however was this: Photo manipulation has always had a bit of a bad name, and even today we&amp;#8217;re still worried that adding, removing or modifying parts of a photographic image detract from photography&amp;#8217;s perceived ability to show us the truth.</description>

      <description>Bruce Sterling is doing the rounds in London at the moment: I caught him on Monday at a New Statesman event upstairs at the Grouse and Claret. Bruce gave a highly entertaining &amp;#8216;cyberpunk exegesis&amp;#8217; of a bewildering array of contemporary issues and ideas: the UK&amp;#8217;s surveillance culture, Web 2.0, Climate Change and of course the Internet of Things to name just a few. Good &amp;#8216;names&amp;#8217; for things seem more important than ever now: Bruce mentioned that Tim O&amp;#8217;Reilly &amp;#8211; who coined the term Web 2.</description>

      <description>Nokia Research recently announced the Apache webserver had been ported to run on S60 phones (see my earlier post). The plan had been to &amp;#8220;bring a full-fledged webserver to S60 and to make a webserver running on a mobile phone accessible from the Internet using any web browser&amp;#8221;. Now the client binary is available for download and you can sign up for an account on Nokia&amp;#8217;s gateway and try this for yourself.</description>

      <description>45 Years ago today, on April 12th 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to go into space. On the same day, 25 years ago, John Young and Robert Crippen flew the first Space Shuttle flight to orbit.

      <description>I was invited today by one of my clients &amp;#8211; The Climate Group &amp;#8211; to watch Al Gore give his presentation on Climate Change at the bfi London IMAX Cinema. Gore&amp;#8217;s presentation is pretty well covered elsewhere, so I&amp;#8217;m not even going to try and summarise it here (it was too dark to take notes and besides I&amp;#8217;m a lousy note-taker anyway). Suffice to say for someone who has a reputation for being boring, he&amp;#8217;s both funny and extremely passionate about our need to find a common moral purpose to deal with this &amp;#8220;planetary emergency&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>From del.ico.us/blog:
 This is a big step for del.icio.us, but one that I hope will make it more useful. Because del.icio.us is all about sharing and we donâ€™t want to discourage that, we will be watching how this feature impacts the community and will also be experimenting a bit with the UI over the next few weeks.

      <description>About the only good thing to result from the theft of my bag just before Christmas was replacing my ageing original 1G iPod with a sleek new black 5G video iPod (whoever thought that glossy white &amp;#8216;iBook&amp;#8217; look was a good idea?). Actually that&amp;#8217;s not strictly true: I&amp;#8217;ve effectively &amp;#8216;upgraded&amp;#8217; many of my closest and most familiar possessions at the cost of many hours cancelling credit cards, talking to insurers and replacing missing Christmas gifts.</description>

      <description>Like most of the UK&amp;#8217;s web development community I was at the Carson Workshops Future of Web Apps summit a couple of weeks ago. A couple of highlights for me were Tom Coates&amp;#8217; wonderfully lucid and entertaining synthesis of all things Web 2.0 (see also Jeremy Zawodny&amp;#8217;s annotations of Tom&amp;#8217;s slides) and David Heinemeier Hansson&amp;#8217;s Ruby on Rails &amp;#8216;sermon&amp;#8217;. Although I&amp;#8217;ve been working with Rails intermittently for at least eighteen months I&amp;#8217;ve never seen David speak and it had never really occurred to me before just how Scandinavian Rails is: minimal, beautifully designed and good for the soul.</description>

      <title>For Your Consideration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bafta.org/&#34;&gt;Orange British Academy Film Awards&lt;/a&gt; take place tonight. For the record, here&amp;#8217;s the complete list of screeners dispatched to BAFTA members this year. Considering we were &lt;span class=&#34;hilite&#34;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; sent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cinea.com/sv300.html&#34;&gt;Cinea players&lt;/a&gt; even before last year&amp;#8217;s awards &amp;#8211; and how quickly unencrypted movies &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.toptechnews.com/story.xhtml?story_id=11300002Q0PZ&#34;&gt;started appearing on the web&lt;/a&gt; this year &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s curious that only about 20% of DVDs were encrypted (using Cinea&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cinea.com/awardscreeners.html&#34;&gt;S-VIEW Award Consideration Screener Program&lt;/a&gt;). Mind you, from the point of view of the studios, encryption can obviously backfire, as those co-ordinating Munich&amp;#8217;s BAFTA campaign discovered when 5000 totally unplayable discs were shipped out, &lt;a href=&#34;http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1683771,00.html&#34;&gt;a story&lt;/a&gt; that even made the front page of The Guardian. &lt;strong&gt;Munich&lt;/strong&gt; is the only movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/noms.html&#34;&gt;Oscar-nominated for best picture&lt;/a&gt; not also on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bafta.org/site/page287.html&#34;&gt;BAFTA shortlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of the bunch for me was Fernando Meirelles&amp;#8217; &lt;strong&gt;The Constant Gardener&lt;/strong&gt;, (conversely the only BAFTA-nominated movie not also up for best picture in the US) a near-perfect exercise in direction, performance and cinematography and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kottke.org/06/02/syriana&#34;&gt;hyperlink movies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Syriana&lt;/strong&gt; (good) and &lt;strong&gt;Crash&lt;/strong&gt; (better). Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were both outstanding in Johnny Cash biopic &lt;strong&gt;Walk the Line&lt;/strong&gt;, as was Felicity Huffman&amp;#8217;s extraordinary woman-plays-man-becoming-woman performance in &lt;strong&gt;Transamerica&lt;/strong&gt; (but sadly overlooked by BAFTA) and you can&amp;#8217;t fail to enjoy Piers Brosnan&amp;#8217;s trashing of his Bond history in &lt;strong&gt;The Matador&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shame not to see Cronenberg&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;A History of Violence&lt;/strong&gt; in the running for more than adapted screenplay (although William Hurt is Oscar-nominated for his supporting role) or the hilarious &lt;strong&gt;A Cock &amp;amp; Bull Story&lt;/strong&gt;, the endlessly prolific Michael Winterbottom&amp;#8217;s attempt to film &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375761195/robbish-21/&#34;&gt;Tristam Shandy&lt;/a&gt; and a role call of current British comedy stars. Deservedly ignored in the UK though was Woody Allen&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Match Point&lt;/strong&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dadblog.co.uk/archives/2006/01/woody_allen_and.html&#34;&gt;Lloyd Shepherd&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; on why we Brits think this movie is &amp;#8216;lamentable&amp;#8217;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Like Shozu, new S60 app Merkitys (Finnish for &amp;#8216;Meaning&amp;#8217;) allows easy upload of images from your phone to Flickr (or your own server). Merkitys however also automatically adds &amp;#8216;context&amp;#8217;, which includes location (i.e. GSM location information: Mobile Country Code, Mobile Network Code, Location Area Code and Cell ID, but also GPS data if you also have a supported receiver) as well as the usual user-defined description and tags etc., and &amp;#8211; curiously &amp;#8211; the addresses of all bluetooth devices in the vicinity.</description>

      <description>PolarView have released a .kmz file for Google Earth providing more Antarctic data, including the location of drift buoys, larger identified icebergs, selected research vessels and research stations, as well as some higher resolution imagery. Naturally I was drawn to Troll, the Norwegian base on Queen Maud Land (named by a popular vote of Norwegian schoolchildren).
Who knows whether I&amp;#8217;ll ever make it to Antarctica for real, but in the meantime my name at least will be heading SOUTH with the Ben Saunders&amp;#8217; sledge.</description>

      <description>In a first step towards allowing users to maintain &amp;#8220;personal mobile websites&amp;#8221;, Nokia research has announced it has ported Apache httpd and mod_python to the S60/Symbian platform. (The code is so far only free for use within Nokia.)
My head is still reeling from the implications of this last paragraph, which seems completely farfetched and yet perfectly obvious at the same time:
 We believe that being able to run a globally accessible personal website on your mobile phone has the potential of changing the Internet landscape.</description>

      <description>From The Jean-Paul Sartre Cookbook:
 I keep creating omelets one after another, like soldiers marching into the sea, but each one seems empty, hollow, like stone. I want to create an omelet that expresses the meaninglessness of existence, and instead they taste like cheese.

I was hoping to get some of this done during &amp;#8216;ketchup&amp;#8217; week, but family, friends and a bumper crop of BAFTA screeners were welcome distractions.
Upgrade to WordPress 2.0.1
I&amp;#8217;ve been localhostin&amp;#8217; the beta for some time, and keeping up with it on wordpress.com, but now it and Steve Smith&amp;#8217;s Tiger Admin plugin are out and there are fixes/workarounds for the WP 2.</description>

      <description>Whilst searching the Opera Mobile forums, I came across this fairly comprehensive list of free software for S60 phones. Some of the links are broken and there&amp;#8217;s nothing on the development side, but a useful list nonetheless.
Also, if you&amp;#8217;re excited by the prospect of Flash Lite 2.0 announced back in November, you&amp;#8217;ll also be excited to hear from this official forum post that this will be available to developers from Macromedia Labs in January.</description>

      <description>Something that seems unnecessarily cumbersome to me is getting a url from my Mac to my phone (a Nokia 6630). So I knocked up a simple solution using QuickSilver and Framework Labs&amp;#8217; Bluetooth Object Push Automator Action stuck together with a little AppleScript.
After you&amp;#8217;ve installed the action, create an Automator workflow using the Push File to Bluetooth Device action, configure it for your device (assuming you&amp;#8217;ve already set up your phone for use with your Mac using the Bluetooth Setup Assistant) and save this to your desktop as an application named Push2Phone.</description>

      <description>15 months after its initial launch, Rails finally reaches 1.0. Maybe now the constant stream of innovation will slow down long enough for some of us to catch up&amp;#8230; oh, wait, perhaps not&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;1.1 is already pretty far along in development and will see some of the biggest upgrades of any Rails release&amp;#8221;.

      <description>The Opera Platform: is this the Konfabulator for mobile?
 The Opera Platform&amp;#8482; SDK is an SDK for developing rich client-side web applications on mobile devices such as Symbian Series60 phones (MS Smartphone support coming soon). With the Opera Platform&amp;#8482; Application Player, developers can create applications that interact with the phone&amp;#8217;s native functionality, such as the phone&amp;#8217;s address book, calendar or message store. In addition, developers can, using Ajax technology, interact directly with a multitude of web services, both home-grown and pre-existing.</description>

      <description>A few months ago Google bought Urchin, provider of web analytics software &amp;#8216;used by over 20% of the Fortune 500&amp;#8242; and also, until their recent move, by TextDrive where this site is hosted. TextDrive seemed unable to re-negotiate a site license for Urchin (and began work on a home-grown Ruby on Rails solution code-named Anemone). Here&amp;#8217;s the reason why: Google Analytics, released today, is essentially Urchin 5 for free. And I was just thinking about buying Mint.</description>

      <description>In the first in an occasional series of &amp;#8216;linked links&amp;#8217; and by way of tribute to Merlin Mann&amp;#8217;s5ives here are some great stories from the English version of Aftenposten, Norway&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;leading quality daily&amp;#8217; that I&amp;#8217;ve bookmarked at del.icio.us* recently.
(I&amp;#8217;m half-Norwegian, so I enjoy keeping up-to-date with what&amp;#8217;s happening in the &amp;#8216;motherland&amp;#8217;, but it&amp;#8217;s a great feed nevertheless.)

      <description>I spent some time yesterday playing around with the Skype API because I wanted to see if I can initiate text-to-speech calls for a project we have in development.
Seems like the Mac OS X API, like the Skype app itself, lags a little behind the Windows/Linux versions and the Applescript interface (which is easiest to use from a cgi script) is only partially implemented.
I did manage to get a simple web-based IM sending app running on OS X server.</description>

      <description>Jon Udell&amp;#8217;spost (via Lifehacker) on Alex Bosworth&amp;#8217;s hack to save semi-private delicious bookmarks using the for:yourname tag prompted me to fix an aspect of my use of delicious that has been bugging me recently.
For a while now, I&amp;#8217;ve been using a variation on Frasier Speirs&amp;#8217; AppleScript to post to delicious directly from QuickSilver, tagging these GTD-style with @review, for those times when I want bookmark something quickly without going to the trouble of describing, annotating and tagging the link.</description>

      <description>For some reason, my PowerBook decided not to recognise me this morning and wouldn&amp;#8217;t allow me to log in. Eventually, I figured out I could reset my (corrupt) account&amp;#8217;s password from the login window using my &amp;#8216;master password&amp;#8217;, but then I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to start up to anything other than a blue screen. (Coincidentally, I&amp;#8217;d earlier read that one ofMac OS X 10.4.3&amp;#8242;s fixes &amp;#8211; released today &amp;#8211; addressed (an unrelated) issue in which high ASCII characters in a password could lead to a blue screen at startup, or prevent log in.</description>

      <description>(Note: this post was originally written on release of the Flex 2 alpha. I&amp;#8217;ve since updated it for the Flex 2 beta.)
Macromedia recently announced Macromedia Labs and the availability of the Flex 2 product line alpha, which includes a new Eclipse-based IDE and a new high performance client runtime (Flash Player 8.5) alongside the development framework. Unfortunately, for now, development on the Mac is not supported and Macromedia only provide an installer for Flex Builder 2, the Flex Framework 2, Flex samples and command line tools for Windows.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been a .Macsubscriber since Apple began charging for what was once a free service, but I can no longer justify the &amp;#8216;equivalent of &amp;pound;5.75 a month&amp;#8217; for Apple&amp;#8217;s suite of Internet services. I&amp;#8217;ve grudgingly paid the $100 fee for the past couple of years, largely for the ability to sync my bookmarks, calendars and contacts across machines, even if each time I&amp;#8217;ve felt vaguely conned at having to pay for something that ought to be free (the same feeling you get on finding out you need to purchase a new QuickTime Pro key with each version bump).</description>

      <description>Went to see Matthew Herbert and his apron-clad &amp;#8216;brigade&amp;#8217; perform Plat du Jour at the Barbican on Monday night. Unfortunately I couldn&amp;#8217;t shake the feeling that Herbert and co were a little bored by the idea of a last London performance (they delayed the start for a few minutes trying to work out if they could do the whole thing in reverse, just to make it more interesting for themselves) and his slightly irritating assumption that most of the audience had seen it before seemed like a reason not to try too hard.</description>

      <description>Although one of the early Flex beta installers for Linux also worked on Mac OS X, this is no longer true for the 1.0 release version. However, this doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it can&amp;#8217;t be installed. All you need to do is extract the WAR files from the installer: unzip -d flex flex-10-lin.bin (extracting the contents of the archive to a new directory &amp;#8216;flex&amp;#8217; in the working directory). These will be in the dist directory at flex/R_/dist.</description>

Over two years in the making this is a &amp;#8216;concept&amp;#8217; album about &amp;#8220;the international language of food&amp;#8221; with some great tunes, including two standout tracks: Celebrity, made entirely from food aimed at children endorsed by celebrities and the only vocal track (&amp;#8220;Go Gordon, go Ramsay, go Beyonc&amp;eacute;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;) and The Nine Seeds Of Navdanya, generated from seeds provided by a conservation organisation in India.</description>

      <description>Knowing my predilection for liquorice, some family members recently brought me box of crushed liquorice root back from Egypt. Rather than drink the infusion, I thought I&amp;#8217;d attempt to recreate a Heston Blumenthal dish we ate at the Fat Duck 18 months ago: SALMON POACHED WITH LIQUORICE. I remembered I&amp;#8217;d kept Blumenthal&amp;#8217;s recipe for liquorice jelly from The Guardian in 2003 for exactly this reason. The dish we ate at the Fat Duck was garnished with chicory (without doubt the best chicory I&amp;#8217;ve ever tasted), but The Guardian version (and the version on today&amp;#8217;s menu at the Fat Duck) recommends pink grapefruit and asparagus alongside the salmon, as &amp;#8220;both liquorice and asparagus contain a compound called asparagine&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Overheard on a train (two women chatting about lunch): &amp;#8220;Is taste symmetrical?&amp;#8221;, meaning Are Human Taste Thresholds Similar on the Right and Left Sides of the Tongue? Basically, the answer is yes: &amp;#8220;taste threshold sensitivity is equivalent on the left and right anterior tongue for most individuals.&amp;#8221;

      <description>David Hempleman-Adams, who broke a 25-year-old world balloon altitude record in December last year with the aim of drawing attention to climate change, broke another world record yesterday, hosting a dinner party for his mates Bear Grylls and Alan Veal, 7,000m (25,000ft) above Salisbury Plain. The three-course meal included asparagus tips, duck a l&amp;#8217;orange and fruit terrine. Dining four miles above the earth has its own particular hazards as Patrick Barkham reports in today&amp;#8217;s Guardian: &amp;#8220;they had to snatch off their masks and gulp their food before taking some more oxygen, while being careful not to drop anything &amp;#8211; a spear of asparagus falling from that height could kill someone.</description>

      <description>This installer adds ActionScript syntax colouring and a Test Movie in Flash command to the awesome TextMate editor for Mac OS X. Test Movie in Flash works with .fla files added to your project (hit Cmd-Rtn with a .fla file selected), although at the moment TextMate displays binary files as text, which for a large file can be slow. Hopefully this issue will be dealt with in the upcoming 1.0.1.</description>

If we could cover his costs he&amp;#8217;d let us have an entire case of knives and a 12-piece cookware set for roughly 10% of the retail price (1425 EURO for the pans, 795 for the knives).</description>

      <description>I wish I&amp;#8217;d had the benefit of this article a few months back when I was setting up my Subversion server. Although the svn documentation is excellent, it&amp;#8217;s good to see a Mac OS X specific tutorial.
Installing Subversion (plus dependencies) using DarwinPorts is really simple: just cd to your darwinports/dports/ directory and type sudo port install subversion +mod_dav_svn. Instructions on how to install DarwinPorts are here.
I put together a Subversion startup item (installed into /Library/StartUpItems/), although really this is just an Apache2 startup item, but I called it Subversion since that&amp;#8217;s all I&amp;#8217;m using Apache2 for.</description>

The Register is suggesting we start paying attention to the &amp;#8220;random collections of (often highly esoteric) words&amp;#8221; that &amp;#8220;spam tsunamists are in the habit of finishing their missives with&amp;#8221;, as if this constituted a form of William Burroughs-like cut-up poetry. Here&amp;#8217;s one I got this morning from spam poet Darla ftdvmufsxkpo@thaimail.com, entitled &amp;#8216;osmotic&amp;#8217;:

      <description>Years ago, Tim and I invented a company called SHEIP, one of XPT&amp;#8217;s clients, who were developing animal networking technology that would enable sheep, for example, each to have individual IP addresses and to be herded remotely. It&amp;#8217;s good to see that this kind of technology really is in development, even if it&amp;#8217;s not quite ready for prime (beef) time: &amp;#8220;A farmer would control multiple herds from a single server at home as if they were playing a video game, said Zack Butler, of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.</description>

      <description>(New: see also ActionScript for TextMate)
I had this working previously in Project Builder, but the specification files were broken in Xcode. Thanks to the C# versions I found here, I&amp;#8217;ve been able to update these for Xcode. This installer adds two files, ActionScript.pbfilespec and ActionScript.pblangspec to /Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Specifications, adding ActionScript syntax colouring and code completion (press opt-esc) to Xcode.
Update: Sam Robbins updated ActionScript.pblangspec to include component methods and properties.</description>

      <description>Just in time for the publication of The Confusion, I finally finished Neal Stephenson&amp;#8217;s Quicksilver. It&amp;#8217;s probably taken me longer to read it than Stephenson took to write it, even in long hand (Colophon: &amp;#8220;The manuscript of The Baroque Cycle was written by hand on 100% cotton paper using three different fountain pens: a Waterman Gentleman, a Rotring, and a Jorg Hysek.&amp;#8221;). I feel like I&amp;#8217;ve been reading it in long eye, although the experience was much enhanced by The Metaweb, a wiki set up by Stephenson and others for the book, especially the Quicksilver annotations page.</description>

      <description>Too bad I just got a very fine 3-piece hand-forged Gyuto Hocho Knife Set from Dick Fine Tools, otherwise I&amp;#8217;d be wanting one of these supposedly the &amp;#8220;world&amp;#8217;s sharpest knives&amp;#8221; and used by some of the world&amp;#8217;s greatest chefs. They may be sharp, but are they made the same way as Samurai swords? I think not.
Next winter&amp;#8217;s purchase from Dick: the Ki-Wari Ono, a Japanse splitting axe that &amp;#8220;will make splitting firewood your favourite chore&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>I spent about two hours today trying to fix my PowerShot S10 so I can take a picture of my phone (don&amp;#8217;t ask). I just kept getting the same E28 error in the viewfinder and then the lens would retract. So I reformatted the CF card and upgraded the [firmware]1 &amp;#8211; still nothing. Finally, I found this thread. The upshot is, no one but Canon knows what the error is and you have to pay them Â£150 to tell you.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve spent any time, as I have over the last year or so, working with Flash as the presentation layer for Java-based webapps, keeping as much of your ActionScript as possible in text files so that you can integrate these with your version control system along with your other source files, and wishing you didn&amp;#8217;t have to use the Flash authoring tool to compile your movies, Flex (formerly Royale), a &amp;#8220;standards-based programming methodology for building the presentation tier of Rich Internet Applications&amp;#8221; from Macromedia (now in beta) might just be what you&amp;#8217;re looking for.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s that time again: Copeland Borough Council presents The World&amp;#8217;s Biggest Liar Competition, held annually at The Bridge Inn, Santon Bridge, Cumbria. This years contest will take place on Thursday, 20th November.
In 2000, Tim and I took part in a Festival of Lying organised around the competition by artists Anna Best, Karen Guthrie, Nina Pope and Simon Poulter. Other speakers included crop circle maker Rob Irving, magician Peter Lamont, author Jon Ronson and Elvis.</description>

      <description>These guys have been working together since 1979, and in 1987 made a film called Der Lauf der Dinge (The Way Things Go) the inspiration behind Honda&amp;#8217;s recent Cog TV advert. Watch the trailer for The Way Things Go and be amazed.
(I&amp;#8217;m reminded of Mehdi Norowzian&amp;#8217;s film Joy which was the starting point for Guinness&amp;#8217;s Anticipation, a hugely popular advert we at NoHo Digital turned into a hugely popular screensaver.</description>

      <description>Jason Salavon&amp;#8217;s work is just sublime. Especially his visualizations of &amp;#8220;statistical data tracking the US domestic production of shoes and slippers from 1960-1998 in 31 categories&amp;#8221;. And the nudes (he should enter these for Miss Digital World).
Update: Inspired by Jason&amp;#8217;s work, Flickr member brevity (Neil Kandalgaonkar) has written an app &amp;#8220;to blend Flickr images which share the same tags&amp;#8221;.  </description>

      <description>Whilst doing some research on Food Science and on Nicholas Kurti in particular, the so-called &amp;#8216;father of Molecular Gastronomy&amp;#8217;, I discovered that Oxford&amp;#8217;s Science Area, where Kurti worked and not far from where I live, is renowned for once having been the &amp;#8216;coldest spot on Earth&amp;#8217;: &amp;#8220;Using demagnetisation of nuclear alignment, Professor Kurti was able to create temperatures of a millionth of a degree above absolute zero.&amp;#8221;
Cool.
Kurti&amp;#8217;s interest in what he called &amp;#8216;gastronomic physics&amp;#8217; also led him to invent an &amp;#8216;Inverted Baked Alaska&amp;#8216; which consisted of frozen meringue filled with piping hot apricot puree, described as &amp;#8216;sticking a spoon into Iceland and getting an eyeful of magma&amp;#8217;.</description>

      <description>At the Damien Hirst show I was struck most by perhaps the smallest and least conspicuous piece in the exhibition, a small &amp;#8216;pills and dead flies&amp;#8217; canvas in White Cube&amp;#8217;s reception. I think this demonstrates what I like most about Damien&amp;#8217;s work, the economy of some of his ideas &amp;#8211; I mean what two small objects of more or less the same size could be more different than a perfectly-formed white pill and a dead fly?</description>

      <description>Tim has been thinking about creative partnerships again, after we joined the crowds at the Hirst show at White Cube yesterday. I followed this up today by going to see Candice Breitz&amp;#8217;s video installations at Modern Art Oxford. One piece in particular struck a chord: Double Karen (Close to You) 2000 which samples video of Karen Carpenter singing a stripped down version of (They Long To Be) Close to You. One of a series of &amp;#8216;duets&amp;#8217; (the others feature Olivia Newton-John, Annie Lennox and Whitney Houston), the work consists of two identical monitors facing each other over a stairwell, showing one Karen singing only the words &amp;#8220;me-me-me&amp;#8221; to the other Karen who sings &amp;#8220;you-you-you&amp;#8221; in reply.</description>

      <description>Jim Bengston, my uncle, has a new show. Most of these images are from the three months of any year Jim spends traveling the US in his Airstream (he&amp;#8217;s originally from Illinois, but has lived in Oslo since the 70s) but there are a few from times and places I recognise, like the one from New Years Eve in Berlin (we all climbed the Teufelsberg, a hill made from all the rubble left in the city after WW2).</description>
