Overheard on a train (two women chatting about lunch): &#8220;Is taste symmetrical?&#8221;, meaning [Are Human Taste Thresholds Similar on the Right and Left Sides of the Tongue?][1] Basically, the answer is **yes**: &#8220;taste threshold sensitivity is equivalent on the left and right anterior tongue for most individuals.&#8221;
