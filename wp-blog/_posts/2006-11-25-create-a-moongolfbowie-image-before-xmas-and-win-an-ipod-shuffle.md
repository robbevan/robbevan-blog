To celebrate the success of the [PlayTime][1] event and continue Tim Wright&#8217;s mission to play [golf on the moon (with David Bowie)][2], XPT is offering a iPod Shuffle to the person who comes up with the best photographic simulation of a particular aspect of the the 30-year plan.

By concretising events and situations in a series of manipulated images, we are making the whole project more real, more achievable. Simulation=Solution. Remember &#8211; don&#8217;t leave space to the professionals.
