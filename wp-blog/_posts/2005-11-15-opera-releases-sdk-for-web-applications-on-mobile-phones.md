[The Opera Platform][1]: is this the [Konfabulator][2] for mobile?

> The Opera Platform&#8482; SDK is an SDK for developing rich client-side web applications on mobile devices such as Symbian Series60 phones (MS Smartphone support coming soon). With the Opera Platform&#8482; Application Player, developers can create applications that interact with the phone&#8217;s native functionality, such as the phone&#8217;s address book, calendar or message store. In addition, developers can, using Ajax technology, interact directly with a multitude of web services, both home-grown and pre-existing.
