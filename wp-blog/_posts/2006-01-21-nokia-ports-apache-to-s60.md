In a first step towards allowing users to maintain &#8220;personal mobile websites&#8221;, Nokia research has announced it has [ported Apache httpd and mod_python to the S60/Symbian platform][1]. (The code is so far only free for use within Nokia.)

My head is still reeling from the implications of this last paragraph, which seems completely farfetched and yet perfectly obvious at the same time:

> We believe that being able to run a globally accessible personal website on your mobile phone has the potential of changing the Internet landscape. If every mobile phone or even every smartphone initially, is equipped with a webserver then very quickly most websites will reside on mobile phones. That is bound to have some impact not only on how mobile phones are perceived but also on how the web evolves.
