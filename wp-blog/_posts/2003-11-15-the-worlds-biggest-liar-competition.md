It&#8217;s that time again: Copeland Borough Council presents [The World&#8217;s Biggest Liar Competition][1], held annually at The Bridge Inn, Santon Bridge, Cumbria. This years contest will take place on Thursday, 20th November.

In 2000, [Tim and I took part][2] in a [Festival of Lying][3] organised around the competition by artists Anna Best, Karen Guthrie, Nina Pope and Simon Poulter. Other speakers included crop circle maker [Rob Irving][4], magician [Peter Lamont][5], author [Jon Ronson][6] and [Elvis][7]. The event was compered by Ralph Spours, a local estate agent, and every time he came on stage the organisers played Adam Ant&#8217;s Prince Charming. The entire track. The winner of *The World&#8217;s Biggest Liar Competition* that year was five-time winner John Graham, but the following year he was defeated by George Kemp (who also won last year) with a story about &#8220;his grandfather&#8217;s greyhound, which gave birth to pups in the middle of a race before going on to win, followed by the puppies&#8221; ([CNN][8]).
