Just in time for the publication of [The Confusion][1], I finally finished Neal Stephenson&#8217;s [Quicksilver][2]. It&#8217;s probably taken me longer to read it than Stephenson took to write it, even in long hand ([Colophon][3]: &#8220;The manuscript of The Baroque Cycle was written by hand on 100% cotton paper using three different fountain pens: a Waterman Gentleman, a Rotring, and a Jorg Hysek.&#8221;). I feel like I&#8217;ve been reading it in long *eye*, although the experience was much enhanced by [The Metaweb][4], a wiki set up by Stephenson and others for the book, especially the Quicksilver [annotations page][5]. If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how to pronounce [Qwghlm][6] (hint: begins with a tongue-click and ends with a swallowing noise) this is where to find out.

Stephenson claims that Qwghlm (a pair of islands situated off the northwestern coast of Britain, which also features in [Cryptonomicon][7]) is a &#8220;a wholly fictitious and fanciful invention&#8221;. I&#8217;m not so sure. I get spam from Qwghlm almost very day (Subject: re: what is the url? tmnsnv nc zkhojqa, Subject: cait concrrring mkuxy bznhboayzggmc, or how about this one: Subject: Re: *OLQJWQEM*, an olive press). My guess is it won&#8217;t be long before I get a Qwghlm-style 419 email detailing hitherto unknown Qwghlmian ancestors and promising a share of an enormous cache of Spanish gold, or perhaps the ruby pendant presented to my great-grandfather John Alexander Tonjoroff (a senator in the Bulgarian Sobranje) by the then Prince Ferdinand in about 1886, and supposedly a family heirloom ever since. 

I also only just discovered from the Quicksilver Metaweb that Stephenson was taking part in [Writers Week][8] at the festival in Adelaide whilst I was there in March (from the [Neil Stephenson Sightings page][9]). Sadly, I was probably in a pub somewhere nearby at the time. Or not so sadly.
