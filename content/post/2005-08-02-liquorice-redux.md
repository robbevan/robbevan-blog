Knowing [my predilection][1] for liquorice, some family members recently brought me box of crushed liquorice root back from Egypt. Rather than drink the infusion, I thought I&#8217;d attempt to recreate a Heston Blumenthal dish [we ate][2] at the [Fat Duck][3] 18 months ago: SALMON POACHED WITH LIQUORICE. I remembered I&#8217;d kept Blumenthal&#8217;s [recipe for liquorice jelly][4] from The Guardian in 2003 for exactly this reason. The dish we ate at the Fat Duck was garnished with chicory (without doubt the best chicory I&#8217;ve ever tasted), but The Guardian version (and the version on today&#8217;s menu at the Fat Duck) recommends pink grapefruit and asparagus alongside the salmon, as &#8220;both liquorice and asparagus contain a compound called asparagine&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t have the required agar flakes to make the <span class="hilite">all</span>-encasing, heat-resistant gelling agent, so in the end simply grilled the salmon, but nevertheless it was terrific, even if the asparagus was from Peru and the dish looked absolutely nothing like [this][5]. My (vege-gel) jelly looks [dark and mysterious][6] in its jar though.

I now also feel like I&#8217;m one step closer to my ambition to [restarting my career as a sculptor by making a grizzly bear-sized liquorice cat][1] (I once made three life-sized marzipan pigs).
