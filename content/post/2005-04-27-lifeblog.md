After a year long fling with Sony Ericsson, I&#8217;ve come back to Nokia and upgraded to a 6630 Smartphone. Actually, I haven&#8217;t dumped the T610 entirely, this will sit next to my server, with a pay as you go SIM, so I can start working on a couple of SMS apps using Tim Ellis&#8217; excellent [UltraSMS][1] utility.

The 6630 is a **great** phone. Not only does it have a very usable 1.3 megapixel camera (I tried to love the T610&#8242;s pitifully lo res images, I really did), there are new development tools like [Flash Lite][2] and [Python for Series 60][3] and a whole bunch of freeware apps: see [David&#8217;s review][4] for some examples, and more [here][5]. Best of <span class="hilite">all</span> though is [Lifeblog][6], Nokia&#8217;s diary/media manager, the perfect accessory to your [Flickr][7] account (see [here][8] for details).

Of course mobile phone love is always short-lived and it doesn&#8217;t take long before you&#8217;re lusting after another, like these just-announced [Nseries][9] phones.

<div class="update">
  Update: If like me you&#8217;re on a Mac and bought a 6630 in the expectation that it would sync with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and were dismayed that it didn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re now in luck: Apple just released <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/isyncupdate21.html">iSync 2.1</a>.
