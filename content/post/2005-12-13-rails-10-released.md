15 months after its initial launch, [Rails][1] finally [reaches 1.0][2]. Maybe now the constant stream of innovation will slow down long enough for some of us to catch up&#8230; oh, wait, perhaps not&#8230; &#8220;1.1 is already pretty far along in development and will see some of the biggest upgrades of any Rails release&#8221;. Can&#8217;t wait.
