From [del.ico.us/blog][1]:

> This is a big step for del.icio.us, but one that I hope will make it more useful. Because del.icio.us is <span class="hilite">all</span> about sharing and we donâ€™t want to discourage that, we will be watching how this feature impacts the community and will also be experimenting a bit with the UI over the next few weeks.
