A few weeks on, I&#8217;m finally getting around to uploading [my slides][1] from my [PlayTime][2] presentation, Playing with Pictures (it&#8217;s a [20MB+ PDF file][1], exported from Keynote). I was intending to annotate these so that they&#8217;d make more sense to someone who weren&#8217;t at my session, but I&#8217;m not sure when, if ever, I&#8217;ll do this.

[<img style="border: 1px solid gray; float: none; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0;"  src="http://robbevan.com/blog/wp-content/themes/robbevan/images/posts/playtime.png" alt="" />][1]

This gist of it however was this: Photo manipulation has always had a bit of a bad name, and even today we&#8217;re still worried that adding, removing or modifying parts of a photographic image detract from photography&#8217;s perceived ability to show us the truth. But you could argue that these techniques &#8211; and especially montage/manipulation (cf. the history of collage, Eisenstein etc, blah blah) &#8211; allow us to see other, new truths (all that nonsense about MegaWords was a joke about quantifying this). And the things you need, stock imagery, skills, tools etc. are becoming more available and affordable all the time: see <span class="hilite">all</span> the examples of the web services* I mentioned. So we&#8217;re going to see a lot more of it, especially with the YouTube generation, and it&#8217;s also something that we (XPT and everyone else) are going to continue to have a lot of fun with&#8230;

*Most of the links to these are embedded in the PDF, but for convenience here are the best of them: [Worth1000][3], [Photoshop Tennis][4], [iStockPhoto][5], [Snipshot][6], [Tourist Remover][7], [Riya Visual Search][8], [Lazy Mask][9], [Zonetag][10], [scanR][11], [retrievr][12], [Mappr][13], [Ning Photos][14] and [Google Moon][15].

News about the Moon-Golf-Bowie photo competition we&#8217;re running and the &#8216;Golf on the Moon&#8217; Google Maps site to follow in a subsequent post.

There I was thinking I&#8217;d completely got out of the habit of blogging.
