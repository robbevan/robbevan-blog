A selection of wines by the glass carefully selected to accompany this menu £50.00

From the individually-prepared green tea and lime meringues, &#8216;cooked&#8217; in liquid nitrogen and served on a spoon &#8211; so cold that we all snorted steam as we ate them, one by one around the table &#8211; to the Orange and Beetroot Jelly (the orange part tasting of beetroot, the purple of orange) <span class="hilite">all</span> the way through to the Bacon and Egg Ice Cream, this was an extraordinary meal. About as different from what we normally call food as a [small pill is from a dead fly][1]. The &#8216;few hidden extras&#8217; included Blumenthal&#8217;s famous white chocolate and caviar combination, parsnip flakes with parsnip milk and a Christmas Tree sherbert dib-dab (or perhaps this was the Douglas Fir again). We obviously also had the carefully selected selection of wines to accompany, ending on a thick gloopy sherry which was unspeakably good. (At the wonderful [Rimrock Resort Hotel][2] in Banff, they call this a &#8216;flight&#8217; of wines, a much better term.) I can&#8217;t think of a better way to have celebrated my 40th.

And two days after we ate there, The Fat Duck was awarded [a third Michelin star][3].

  Update: <a href="http://www.tastingmenu.com/archive/2005/10-october/20051019.htm">tastingmenu</a> has a course-by-course <a href="http://www.tastingmenu.com/media/2004/20040602-fatduck/index.html">photo album</a> that records the entire Fat Duck &#8216;Degustation Menu&#8217; experience, albeit some 6 months or so later and in daylight, so it doesn&#8217;t quite match ours.
