<strike>[This installer][1] adds ActionScript syntax colouring and a Test Movie in Flash command to the awesome [TextMate][2] editor for Mac OS X. *Test Movie in Flash* works with .fla files added to your project (hit Cmd-Rtn with a .fla file selected), although at the moment TextMate displays binary files as text, which for a large file can be slow. Hopefully this issue will be dealt with in the upcoming 1.0.1.

[The installer][1] adds the bundle to `/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/`. If you prefer to do it manually (if you want to put it in `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/` for example), [download the bundle][3].</strike>

<div class="update">
  Update: the latest version of the ActionScript bundle can be checked out from the MacroMates <a href="http://anon:anon@macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/">Subversion repository</a>.
