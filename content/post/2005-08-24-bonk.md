A few years ago, after [we][1] had first created [the fictional world of XPT][2], my brother (who&#8217;s a lot more familiar with the art world than I was then or now) alerted me to Finnish artist [Alvar Gullichsen&#8217;s][3] Bonk Business Inc.  
> &#8230;a multiglobal industrial enterprise at the forefront of 3rd millennium technologies. The company is the world leader in fully Defunctioned Machinery, Cosmic Therapy applications, Advanced Disinformation Systems (ADS), Repacked consumer products and LBH (Localized Black Hole) technology.</p>
<span class="hilite">All</span> this began when an anchovy fisherman&#8217;s family more than 150 years ago discovered an ancient recipe for [Garum][4], a &#8220;mildly stimulating condiment made from the anchovy&#8221; and anchovy oil, which &#8220;greased the wheels of Nordic industry for many decades until overfishing by interlopers in the Baltic caused the Great Oil Crisis of 1883&#8243; (<span class="hilite">all</span> this and more from the hilariously deadpan [Bonk History][5] page). Bonk&#8217;s re-definition of [R&D][6] as Repacking and Disinformation seems like a good definition of what [we&#8217;ve been doing][7] at XPT in the last few years too. (Personally, I&#8217;ve always wanted to *repackage* an airline, turning air travel into something much more transformative &#8211; like [Kahuna Airlines][8] in Pynchon&#8217;s [Vineland][9] &#8211; and for a while Tim and I worked intermittently on an idea called LA Jet ([La Jet&eacute;e][10] without the &#8216;e&#8217;s&#8230;) along those lines. Perhaps it&#8217;s time to start working on the livery again.)

The machines, photographs, products, artifacts, graphics and written history that made up the world of Bonk were exhibited widely in the mid to late 90s and the company even featured in the first issue of [Fast Company][11] in a 1995 article entitled [The Finnish Company that&#8217;s Never Done][12]. Also worth checking out are Bonk team member [Magnus Scharmanoff&#8217;s images][13] of the various Bonk machines.

I was reminded of <span class="hilite">all</span> of this when I discovered (by looking up the exact meaning of the cycling term [Bonk][14] on [Wikipedia][15]!) that Bonk&#8217;s web presence hadn&#8217;t stagnated as a bunch of first-generation websites and that there&#8217;s now a shiny modern website for the [Bonk Museum][16] in Uusikaupunki.
