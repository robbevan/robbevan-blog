Whilst doing some research on Food Science and on Nicholas Kurti in particular, the so-called &#8216;father of Molecular Gastronomy&#8217;, I discovered that [Oxford&#8217;s Science Area][1], where Kurti worked and not far from where I live, is renowned for once having been the &#8216;coldest spot on Earth&#8217;: &#8220;Using demagnetisation of nuclear alignment, Professor Kurti was able to create temperatures of a millionth of a degree above absolute zero.&#8221;

Cool.

Kurti&#8217;s interest in what he called &#8216;gastronomic physics&#8217; also led him to invent an &#8216;[Inverted Baked Alaska][2]&#8216; which consisted of frozen meringue filled with piping hot apricot puree, described as &#8216;sticking a spoon into Iceland and getting an eyeful of magma&#8217;. Here is Heston Blumenthal&#8217;s recent update of Kurti&#8217;s original recipe in the Guardian: [Nicholas Kurti&#8217;s stuffed profiteroles][3].
