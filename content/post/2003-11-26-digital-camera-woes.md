I spent about two hours today trying to fix my PowerShot S10 so I can take a picture of my phone (don&#8217;t ask). I just kept getting the same E28 error in the viewfinder and then the lens would retract. So I reformatted the CF card and upgraded the [firmware][1] (a bit of a hair-raising experience: one false move and the camera&#8217;s toast) &#8211; still nothing. Finally, I found [this thread][2]. The upshot is, no one but Canon knows what the error is and you have to pay them Â£150 to tell you. Or you can bang it hard&#8230; so I did. Now fixed!
