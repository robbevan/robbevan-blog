I&#8217;m a huge fan of [Basecamp][1] and have been a happy and productive basecamper for six months or so. My favourite feature has always been the To-Do list and now [37signals][2] have released this as a separate app: [Ta-da Lists][3]. In their own words, &#8220;just what you need and nothing you don&#8217;t&#8221;. Best of <span class="hilite">all</span>, it&#8217;s **free**.
