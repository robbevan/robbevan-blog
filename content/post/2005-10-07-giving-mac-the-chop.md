Today I let my [.Mac][1]<img alt="" border="0" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=ahl0p0BaPBE&#038;bids=80901.10000001&#038;type=3&#038;subid=0" /> subscription expire. I&#8217;ve been a [.Mac][1]<img alt="" border="0" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=ahl0p0BaPBE&#038;bids=80901.10000001&#038;type=3&#038;subid=0" /> subscriber since Apple began charging for what was once a free service, but I can no longer justify the &#8216;equivalent of &pound;5.75 a month&#8217; for Apple&#8217;s suite of Internet services. I&#8217;ve grudgingly paid the $100 fee for the past couple of years, largely for the ability to sync my bookmarks, calendars and contacts across machines, even if each time I&#8217;ve felt vaguely conned at having to pay for something that ought to be free (the same feeling you get on finding out you need to purchase a new QuickTime Pro key with each version bump).

Even with the latest upgrade from 250MB to a mere 1GB of combined email/storage, as webmail .Mac really doesn&#8217;t cut it alongside [Gmail][3] and for [$8/month with Strongspace][4] I&#8217;ve got four times as much secure offsite storage.

So it&#8217;s goodbye [.Mac][1]<img alt="" border="0" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=ahl0p0BaPBE&#038;bids=80901.10000001&#038;type=3&#038;subid=0" />.

<p class="update">
  Update: One of the things I did like about .Mac was Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/backup.html">Backup</a> app, which at version 3 was finally <a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2005/09/21/backup-3/">worthy of its name</a>. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.textsnippets.com/posts/show/189">a way to replicate</a> Backup&#8217;s handy &#8216;Personal Data and Settings&#8217; plan using <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/">rsync</a> and <a href="http://strongspace.com">Strongspace</a>.

  Update: <a href="http://rentzsch.com/">&#8216;Wolf&#8217; Rentzsc</a>h on why <a href="http://rentzsch.com/suck/backup3">&#8220;Backup 3 is easily the worst piece of software Apple is shipping today&#8221;</a>. Although version 3.0.1, just released via Software Update, may address some of these issues: &#8220;Backup 3.0.1 addresses file restoration and other issues and is highly recommended for <span class="hilite">all</span> users of Backup 3.0&#8243;.

  Update: on the subject of QuickTime Pro, here&#8217;s <a href="http://e-scribe.com/news/120">a fantastic rant</a> about &#8220;the split between Quicktime and QuickTime Pro and what a silly anachronism it is&#8221;.
