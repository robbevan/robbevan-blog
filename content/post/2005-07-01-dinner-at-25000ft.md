[David Hempleman-Adams][1], who broke a 25-year-old world balloon altitude record in December last year with the aim of [drawing attention to climate change][2], broke another world record yesterday, hosting a dinner party for his mates Bear Grylls and Alan Veal, 7,000m (25,000ft) above Salisbury Plain. The three-course meal included asparagus tips, duck a l&#8217;orange and fruit terrine. Dining four miles above the earth has its own particular hazards as Patrick Barkham reports in today&#8217;s Guardian: &#8220;they had to snatch off their masks and gulp their food before taking some more oxygen, while being careful not to drop anything &#8211; *a spear of asparagus falling from that height could kill someone*.&#8221;
