Apart from the obvious need/desire to post more often, here&#8217;s a bunch of improvements I want to make to this blog in the coming weeks. I was hoping to get some of this done during [&#8216;ketchup&#8217; week][1], but family, friends and a [bumper crop of BAFTA screeners][2] were welcome distractions.

<strike>**[Upgrade to WordPress 2.0.1][3]**  
I&#8217;ve been localhostin&#8217; the beta for some time, and keeping up with it on [wordpress.com][4], but now it and [Steve Smith&#8217;s][5] [Tiger Admin plugin][6] are out and there are fixes/workarounds for the WP 2.0-MarsEdit 1.1 issues it&#8217;s time to upgrade this install.</strike>

**Categorise posts better**  
Been holding off on a complete reorganisation of categories until I can take advantage of the new &#8216;Ajax Category Addition&#8217; feature of WP 2.0. A few top level categories, with more obviously separate feeds, and many more tag-like secondary ones are what&#8217;s needed, along with [improved][7] [ways][8] to navigate these.

**Release some WP plugins**  
I&#8217;ve written a couple of plugins for use on this site and I have some others in development. First release will likely be the one I&#8217;ve been using to display [favicons][9] in my [Link-categorised posts][10]. Perhaps I&#8217;ll use my so far dormant [wordpress.com site][11] for plugin-related announcements.

**Add new sections and links**  
Aside from adding some other site sections (about, contact, the usual stuff, plus a few extras), I want to add a whole bunch of links by publishing my list of [NetNewsWire][12] subscriptions, probably using [this OMPL renderer][13].

**Get tumbling**  
I&#8217;d like to get into the habit of &#8220;quick and dirty stream of consciousness&#8221; [tumblelog-style][14] posting, either here or [elsewhere][15]. If you&#8217;re going to do this well it obviously requires real commitment, very streamlined processes and clear differentiation from the [best][16] [examples][17].
