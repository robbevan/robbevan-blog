Nokia Research recently announced the Apache webserver had been ported to run on S60 phones (see [my earlier post][1]). The plan had been to &#8220;bring a full-fledged webserver to S60 and to make a webserver running on a mobile phone accessible from the Internet using any web browser&#8221;. Now the client binary is [available for download][2] and you can sign up for an account on Nokia&#8217;s gateway and try this for yourself.

Here&#8217;s Apache running on my [N70][3].

(I recently upgraded to the N70 from the 6630: I wasn&#8217;t sure whether to wait for a S60 3rd Edition phone but in the end the 2 megapixel slide-and-shoot camera, the flash and larger memory won me over even if the tiny keyboard and <span class="hilite">all</span>-blue backlighting is a considerable step in the wrong direction, usability-wise).

From the Read Me:

> Raccoon consists of two parts: a Symbian port of the Apache httpd webserver and a &#8220;connector&#8221; that together with a gateway provides a mobile phone with a global name in the operator networks of today. In short, you can now host a website on your mobile phone that is accessible from any web browser on the Internet.

There is a lot of (demo) functionality to explore: &#8220;there are custom modules for accessing the core functionality of the phone &#8211; camera, contacts, favourites, log and messages &#8211; and modules for sending instant and inbox messages to the phone, and a module for finding mobile websites in the proximity&#8221;.

Now that I&#8217;ve got this up and running I guess I need to get to work on my [mobsite][4].
