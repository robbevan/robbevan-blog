At the [Damien Hirst show][1] I was struck most by perhaps the smallest and least conspicuous piece in the exhibition, a small &#8216;pills and dead flies&#8217; canvas in White Cube&#8217;s reception. I think this demonstrates what I like most about Damien&#8217;s work, the economy of some of his ideas &#8211; I mean what two small objects of more or less the same size could be more different than a perfectly-formed white pill and a dead fly?

The rest of the show aims to &#8220;examine, dissect and recast the story of Jesus and the Disciples&#8221; but to me <span class="hilite">all</span> these cases full of blood, guts and medical instruments always look as though Hirst is doing Francis Bacon in the style of Joseph Beuys, his own version of [One Song to the Tune of Another][2]. The butterfies are always lovely though.

We did get quite excited about <span class="hilite">all</span> the kitchen knives that Hirst (or perhaps his assistants) used to stab the four cows heads in formaldehyde tanks upstairs (*Matthew, Mark, Luke and John*). I&#8217;m pretty sure these were <span class="hilite">all</span> [Henckels][3] knives. Henckels, or Zwilling J.A. Henckels, have one of the oldest trademarks in the world, a &#8216;twin&#8217; symbol and [as Tim has noted][4] Damien definitely has a thing about twins.
