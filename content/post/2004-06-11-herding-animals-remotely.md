Years ago, [Tim][1] and I invented a company called SHEIP, one of [XPT&#8217;s clients][2], who were developing animal networking technology that would enable sheep, for example, each to have individual IP addresses and to be herded remotely. It&#8217;s good to see that this kind of technology [really is in development][3], even if it&#8217;s not quite ready for prime (beef) time: &#8220;A farmer would control multiple herds from a single server at home as if they were playing a video game, said [Zack Butler][4], of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.&#8221; (From New Scientist, June 7, 2004, via [Engadget][5] and [Roland Piquepaille][6]).
