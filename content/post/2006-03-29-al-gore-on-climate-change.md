I was invited today by one of my clients &#8211; [The Climate Group][1] &#8211; to watch [Al Gore][2] give his presentation on Climate Change at [the bfi London IMAX Cinema][3]. Gore&#8217;s presentation is [pretty][4] [well][5] [covered][6] elsewhere, so I&#8217;m not even going to try and summarise it here (it was too dark to take notes and besides I&#8217;m a lousy note-taker anyway). Suffice to say for someone who has a reputation for being boring, he&#8217;s both funny and extremely passionate about our need to find a common moral purpose to deal with this &#8220;planetary emergency&#8221;.

Here&#8217;s Al Gore and The Climate Group&#8217;s Steve Howard standing beneath &#8220;one of the world&#8217;s most widely recognised and requested photographs of <span class="hilite">all</span> time&#8221; the last [image of the Earth][7] shot by a human being (from Apollo 17 in 1972).

The vertiginous, somewhat uncomfortable feeling you get sitting up close to an IMAX screen (the UK&#8217;s largest) really enhanced the images of huge ice shelves collapsing into the sea and <span class="hilite">all</span> the ensuing discussion of &#8216;tipping points&#8217;&#8230;

(See also [The Climate Group&#8217;s coverage][11] of today&#8217;s event).
