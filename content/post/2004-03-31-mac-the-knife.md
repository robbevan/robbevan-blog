Too bad I just got a very fine 3-piece hand-forged [Gyuto Hocho Knife Set][1] from [Dick Fine Tools][2], otherwise I&#8217;d be wanting [one of these][3] supposedly the &#8220;world&#8217;s sharpest knives&#8221; and used by some of the [world&#8217;s greatest chefs][4]. They may be sharp, but are they made the same way as Samurai swords? I think not.

Next winter&#8217;s purchase from Dick: the [Ki-Wari Ono][5], a Japanse splitting axe that &#8220;will make splitting firewood your favourite chore&#8221;. As if it wasn&#8217;t already.
