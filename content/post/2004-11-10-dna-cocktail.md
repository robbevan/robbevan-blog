One of the highlights for me at the [PAL Digital Science Lab][1] for [Wellcome][2]/[NESTA][3] I attended recently was an evening spent sampling a couple of Dean Maddon&#8217;s [cocktails of nucleic acids][4]. I&#8217;m pleased to note that [the recipe][5] is available online. Best served in a test tube, obviously.
