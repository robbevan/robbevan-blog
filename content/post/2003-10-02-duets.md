[Tim][1] has been thinking about creative partnerships again, after we joined the crowds at the Hirst show at White Cube yesterday. I followed this up today by going to see [Candice Breitz&#8217;s][2] video installations at [Modern Art Oxford][3]. One piece in particular struck a chord: **Double Karen (Close to You) 2000** which samples video of Karen Carpenter singing a stripped down version of *(They Long To Be) Close to You*. One of a series of &#8216;duets&#8217; (the others feature Olivia Newton-John, Annie Lennox and Whitney Houston), the work consists of two identical monitors facing each other over a stairwell, showing one Karen singing only the words &#8220;me-me-me&#8221; to the other Karen who sings &#8220;you-you-you&#8221; in reply.

Partnerships, it seems to me, are always like a bit like this, and remain healthy for as long you get to sing both sides of the song from time to time.
