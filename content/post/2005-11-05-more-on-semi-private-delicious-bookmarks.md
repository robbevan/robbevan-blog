[Jon Udell&#8217;s][1][post][2] (via [Lifehacker][3]) on [Alex Bosworth&#8217;s][4] hack to [save semi-private delicious bookmarks][5] using the for:yourname tag prompted me to fix an aspect of my use of [delicious][6] that has been bugging me recently.

For a while now, I&#8217;ve been using a variation on [Frasier Speirs&#8217; AppleScript][7] to post to [delicious][6] directly from [QuickSilver][8], tagging these [GTD-style][9] with @review, for those times when I want bookmark something quickly without going to the trouble of describing, annotating and tagging the link.

More often than not, this means that I end up with a whole list of raw urls I haven&#8217;t bothered to organise: not something I really want to share and not much use to me or other [delicious][6] users. The perfect place for these to appear would be in your [delicious][6] inbox (except that in [delicious][6] parlance, your inbox is a place for users/tags you&#8217;re subscribed to), but having them show up in your private for: bucket is a good substitute.

Trouble is, as Jon [says: ][2]&#8220;I&#8217;d also like to be able to delete things in my for: bucket. That wouldn&#8217;t mean deleting the sender&#8217;s bookmarklets, but rather rejecting for: tags aimed at me.&#8221; If you use Alex&#8217;s [generated bookmarklet][5] you have no control over the source of your incoming for: tagged links. One solution to this is to create your own &#8216;feeder&#8217; account (with username yourname.private for example) from which you can target links to your main account&#8217;s for: bucket and then delete them when you&#8217;re done.

So now, my [QuickSilver][8] action posts to my &#8216;feeder&#8217; account, tagging links with for:robbevan, my [&#8216;real&#8217; account][10].

I still have [a huge number][11] of @review posts to deal with though&#8230;
