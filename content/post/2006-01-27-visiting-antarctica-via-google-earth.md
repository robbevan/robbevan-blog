[PolarView][1] have released [a .kmz file][2] for [Google Earth][3] providing more [Antarctic data][4], including the location of drift buoys, larger identified icebergs, selected research vessels and research stations, as well as some higher resolution imagery. Naturally I was drawn to [Troll][5], the Norwegian base on Queen Maud Land (named by a popular vote of Norwegian schoolchildren).

Who knows whether I&#8217;ll ever [make it to Antarctica][6] for real, but in the meantime my name at least will be heading [SOUTH][7] with the Ben Saunders&#8217; [sledge][8]. I&#8217;ve just purchased [mile 897][9] of Ben and team-mate Tony Haile&#8217;s 1800-mile trip to the pole and back.
